# armello-replay

The goal of this project is to create a browser-based replay tool for the game "[Armello](https://armello.com/)".

The tool operates by parsing log files created by the game, which contain enough information to recreate the events of the match.
In the process the match data is stored in the page itself. As such, a user can simply save the page to create a fixed recording of the chosen match, which can then be archived, shared or otherwise distributed.

The tool is intended for use by Armello players or communities who want to share their particularly memorable plays.

This project uses derivatives of certain in-game resources, used without permission.

You can find release version (single-file) [here](https://github.com/the-vindicar/armello-replay/releases/).
